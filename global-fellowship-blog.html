								<summary><h8><strong>Dinacon is Over</strong> <emphasis>September 2, 2019</emphasis></h8></summary>
								<p>I just finished a week of the Digital Naturalism Conference (dinacon.org) in Gamboa, Panama. It was an intense and life-giving week. 
              The best part was probably meeting a bunch of women doing great work like <a href=https://jnkummer.wixsite.com/jannenorakummer>Janne</a>, <a href=https://www.instagram.com/lisaannschonberg/?hl=en>Lisa</a>, <a href=https://www.instagram.com/kristina._.dutton/?hl=en>Kristina</a>, <a href=http://www.tiareribeaux.com/>Tiare</a>, <a href=http://www.mab.space/about/>Madeline</a>, and many, many others. A lot of the dudes were great too, especially Ashlin and of course,
              my partner Albert, but there's something magical about working with non-men (i.e. women and non-binary folks). In general, they so easily handle vulnerability, use it 
              as fodder for connection. For example, one of the last nights, when there was a party at "the mansion" (a crazy nice house built by the somewhat disgraced former president 
              of the Smithsonian institute in Panama, where several dinasaurs were staying) a group of us were sitting out on the deck chatting and someone gently 
              chided me for underselling my work. I said, "I know, I've been doing that too much this week. I've just been feeling a little out of place here as a writer."
              "You've been feeling out of place?" one of the group asked. "I've been feeling out of place as a musican." And then sooo quickly it turned into a nice discussion of how we each feel pressure to mold our work to a 
              platonic ideal of a project and how that pressure is pretty much bullshit and how we're all doing fine work. Bing, bang, boom, we all can move on to talking about interests and future projects a little more settled
              and confident. People were asking each other questions, listening, trading off and getting inspired. So different from the info dump competitive style of communication you see in more masc spaces. I loved it.</p>
								<p>Gamboa, of course, is beautiful and fascinating--a little ghost town/American style neighborhood right next to the Panama Canal, in the middle of one of the most biodiverse jungles anywhere. Noriega holed up in one of the buildings
              back in the day before American troops dropped down tanks from helicopters and rolled up on him, afterwards leaving jeep doors and rocket launchers strewn about town. Many buildings were abandoned once the work on the canal was done, 
              so now you can do things like drink beers in a falling down Catholic church and even spray paint a portrait of your strange looking dog on an old community center, like a certain frog scientist did last year. The town is mostly 
              scientists from the Smithsonian, plus people like Andy and Kitty, who are doing their own crazy open lab thing in addition to putting on events like Dinacon. Biodiversity means lots of 
              crazy animals, and if you wanna see vids of sloths and leafcutter ants, you can check out my instagram @dezmediah. Oh yeah, and if you wanna see the generative poems I made you can go<a href=https://dezmediah.com/poems.html> here</a></p>
								<p>Now I'm in Panama City for a few days and so far it's been good food, hot weather, and basking in a little luxury at the hotel, 
									after a week of sharing a room with several other people and eating a lot of canned vegetables. I'll check back in here in a few days mabes.</p>

								<summary><h8><strong>Mujeres Only</strong> <emphasis>September 6, 2019</emphasis></h8></summary>
								<p>Honestly my experience in Panama City was oversshadowed by my experience of the Panama City airport, in which I was misgendered three times, twice of which I was stopped from going into a women's bathroom 
									(while on my period no less, which feels especially insulting). It actually made me consider growing out my hair again 
									because God, I'd like to be able to go to the bathroom without proving my gender, and this bathroom thing has happened to me
									in Cambridge too. But the facts about Panama City are that I had great ceviche, and a great mojito, and incredible
									ramen (?) and the city is quite beautiful, and our fancy "digital nomad" hospital didn't have water or electricity for twelve hours and on that morning the power was out
									my partner and I wandered the darkened hallways for fiteen minutes looking for a way out and it felt like we were in a zombie video game. But that night, a giant rainbow did appear while we were on the roof drinking a beer.</p>
								<p> Also, the Panama Canal is pretty fascinating.</p>

								<summary><strong>I dyed my hair and ate the best tacos of my life</strong><emphasis>September 8, 2019</emphasis></summary> 
								<p>Mexico City is so cool, like a more interesting NYC, less of a capitalist hellscape. My Spanish is passable, which felt pretty good
									on the first day, and then felt less and less good every time I had to stop and say "lo siento, mi espanol no es tan bueno." I've been enjoying working on my novel
									in this lovely room, although I made the mistake of sending my newly re-written first chapter to my partner this morning without explaining that I only wanted encouragement
									really at this stage, which maybe he should've known, but it's all good now and either way, I found myself crying for two hours and you know what I learned from that? That I really care about this fucking project. I didn't 
									cry because I didn't have faith in the project, but because I know it has the potential to bring pleasure, and I want so badly to be able to make that come through.</p>
								<p> In other news, I got my hair dyed blonde and ate easily the best tacos of my life at Orinoco. My only complaint with the food scene here, which is just extraordinary,
									is that it seems like in order to get a good glass of wine you have to go to an Italian restaurant, 
									of which there are many, more than I'd prefer, and so far none are that good. At least not the one I'm at now. I'm eating fancy curly fries, guys. Why do I want wine then? 
									There's hundreds of amazing taco places I could be eating at, and drinking cerveza if I really want to drink, but I've been craving wine. Maybe it's because
									this city reminds me somewhat of Paris, maybe because I'm writing, maybe it's my period.</p>
