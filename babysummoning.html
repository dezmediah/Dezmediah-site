<h1> Baby Summoning Gathering </h1>

<p><b>When:</b> Saturday, June 12, 7pm-10pm</p>
<p><b>Where:</b> Dez and Albert's house, 674 Federal Ter SE, Atlanta, GA 30315</p>

<p> <b>What:</b> If you didn’t know, we are having a child. It’s a strange time to have a kid, coming out of a year when our community networks 
  have been severely disrupted. We want to use this new life as an opportunity to reconnect with community energy, and set intentions for how we want to shape our world for all of those coming after us. </p>
<p>We are asking you to join us to kindle positive energy in our home, where we plan to have the birth. No gifts, please, but if you would like to bring an offering from the earth or something you’ve made to welcome this baby into the world, that’d be lovely. 
  This could be a fruit you picked, a rock you think looks cool, a sketch, some kind of potion you’ve concocted, a leaf, some dirt, whatever. 
  Also, your presence is enough.</p>
<p>Help us summon this child! Bonus points for everyone if Dez goes into labor during the gathering.</p>
<p>We’ll provide some limited booze and snacks (possibly a big pot of boiled peanuts??), but feel free to bring anything else you might like to consume. </p>

<p> <b>CAVEAT:</b> Dez's due date is June 19th and so there is a chance they will go into labor before this party. Possibly the baby summoning energies will 
  work before the party even happens. If this is the case, or if we get rained out or something, we will let y'all know.</p>

<p> Please fill out the form below at some point in the next week to let us know if you're coming or not.
