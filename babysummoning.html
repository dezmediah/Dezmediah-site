<h1> Baby Summoning / Dez Birthday / Peanut Boil / Early Solstice Gathering </h1>

<p><b>When:</b> Sunday, June 12, 6pm-9pm</p>
<p><b>Where:</b> Dez and Albert's backyard, 674 Federal Ter SE, Atlanta, GA 30315</p>

<p> <b>What:</b> If you didn’t know, we are having a baby imminently. It’s a strange time to have a kid, coming out of a year when our community networks 
  have been severely disrupted. We want to use this occasion to reconnect with community energy, and set intentions for how we want to shape our world 
  both for ourselves and for those coming after us. 
  We are asking you to join us to kindle positive energy in our home, where we plan to have the birth. No gifts, please, but if you would like to bring an offering
  from the earth or something you’ve made, that’d be lovely. 
  This could be a fruit you picked, a rock you think looks cool, a sketch, some kind of potion you’ve concocted, a leaf, some dirt, whatever. 
  But really, your presence is more than enough.</p>
<p>Help us summon this baby! The due date (and Dez's birthday!) is the 19th. Bonus points for everyone if Dez goes into labor during the gathering. 
  We’ll provide some limited booze and snacks (including a bit pot o' boiled peanuts), but feel free to bring anything else you might like to consume. </p>

<p> <b>CAVEAT:</b> There is a chance the baby summoning energies will work before the party even happens and Dez will go into labor.
   If this is the case, we will let y'all know.</p>

<p> If you know ahead of time that you can or can't make it, it would be helpful if you could fill out the form below to let us know.</p>
